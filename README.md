# Reimagining Supply Chains in an Era of Increased Renewable Energy Penetration
Repository for Final Year Project at Imperial College for my MEng Electronic and Information Engineering degree.

## Description
There is a dramatic increase in the penetration of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) (wind and solar photovoltaic (PV)), in electricity grids globally. This presents technical and economic “grid integration”
challenges that can be split into two main buckets: 

- the technology challenge, related to the interfacing of the VRE into the grids via power electronics at very short time scales, seconds and below and
  
-  the balancing challenge, related to the variability and predictability of the primary energy resources i.e. the wind and sun at longer time scales, minutes to decades.

The balancing challenge at time scales of minutes to days has viable solutions which are already deployed and are scaling up in parallel with the penetration of VRE. These include storage (i.e. batteries and pumped storage), demand side management and non VRE generation (i.e. fossil fuel, carbon capture, nuclear, non-variable renewables). Longer-term imbalances (weeks, seasons, years) require very significant volumes of energy stored over long periods making storage solutions extremely uneconomic, and most of the current demand side is not capable of flexibility over these time frames.

This project aims to illustrate proof of principle of this concept of long-term demand side management, followed by engineering, economic and societal impact and acceptance
