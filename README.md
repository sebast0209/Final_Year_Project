## üóÇÔ∏è Codebase Organisation

The project repository is organised into two main directories:

- `data/`: Contains all input datasets, including time series electricity price data from the  
  [NREL Cambium dataset](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium). This project uses data specific to the CAISO region.

- `src/`: Contains all modelling scripts, grouped by experiment type. Each experiment has:
  - A Julia script to run the optimisation model
  - A `results/` subfolder where output Excel files are saved
  - A MATLAB script to analyse the results

### üî¨ Experiment Directory Structure

| Experiment | Description | Julia Script | MATLAB Analysis |
|------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **OPEX Planning ‚Äì Zero Inventory** | Models short-term operational expenditure without storage flexibility | [`zero_inventory.jl`](src/OPEX_zero_inventory/zero_inventory.jl) | [`analysis.m`](src/OPEX_zero_inventory/results/analysis.m) |
| **OPEX Planning ‚Äì Infinite Inventory** | Allows full inventory flexibility to evaluate the upper bound of DSM value | [`infinite_inventory.jl`](src/OPEX_infinite_inventory/infinite_inventory.jl) | [`analysis.m`](src/OPEX_infinite_inventory/results/analysis.m) |
| **Capacity Experiments** | Tests the effect of varying production and storage capacity levels | [`cap_experiment.jl`](src/OPEX_capacity_experiments/cap_experiment.jl) | [`analysis.m`](src/OPEX_capacity_experiments/results/analysis.m) |
| **CAPEX-OPEX Planning** | Jointly optimises capital investment and operational cost across the supply chain | [`capex_opex.jl`](src/CAPEX_OPEX_Planning/capex_opex.jl) | [`analysis.m`](src/CAPEX_OPEX_Planning/results/analysis.m) |

> üí° All results are written to Excel format in each experiment's `results/` folder.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on Output Files

If you wish to rerun any of the Julia experiments, you **must** update the output file path defined within each script.  
By default, output files are saved with names like `2025a.xlsx` or `2050a.xlsx`, and running a script without renaming this path may overwrite existing results.

#### Example

To run the **infinite inventory** experiment:

1. Open the file [`src/OPEX_infinite_inventory/infinite_inventory.jl`](src/OPEX_infinite_inventory/infinite_inventory.jl)  
2. Scroll to the bottom and locate the following lines:

   ```julia
   run_scenario("../data/CAISO_MC_2050.xlsx", "2050a")
   run_scenario("../data/CAISO_MC_2025.xlsx", "2025a")
